## Description

- I am motivated to create this project to not only work on my responsive HTML and CSS skills, but also build a portfolio that I can show off to future employers.
- I created this project in order to showcase my skills as a developer with both the portfolio itself as well as the projects that are included on it. 
- By creating this portfolio, I solved the problem of having a place to store the projects that I have created to show off to future employers
- Through doing this activity, I learned more about organizing HTML and CSS, how to make the webpage responsive, and how to include other projects in a portfolio application
