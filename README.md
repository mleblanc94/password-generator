# Password Generator
An application the generates a random password for a user after they specify how long and what kind of characters they would like it to contain.

## Description

- I am motivated to create this project to work on my Javascript skills and also to provide users with a way to generate a password that meets their specifications.
- I created this project to work on my javascript looping skills and ability to write functions. I was able to connect all of this together to return a user a response and random password!
- By creating this application, I solved the problem of ever needing to think of a random password on my own again! In the future, I will always use this application for my random passwords.
- Through doing this activity, I learned more about using javascript in real life applications. Particularly, using for loops, declaring variables, writing and using functions, using if statements, and generally concatnating different things to produce a random password.
